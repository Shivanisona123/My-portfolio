I developed a personal portfolio using **React**, **HTML**, and **CSS** that includes four key sections: **About Me**, **Skills**, **Projects**, and **Contact**. In the **About Me** section, I describe my background, experience, and expertise. The **Skills** section highlights my technical abilities, including programming languages, frameworks, and tools I am proficient in. The **Projects** section showcases my work, providing detailed explanations of each project I've completed, emphasizing their impact and technologies used. Finally, the **Contact** section features a form for direct communication. The portfolio is responsive, and to run it locally, users can execute `npm run dev`.
